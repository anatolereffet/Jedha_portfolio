# Objective 
Based on the data of www.datascienceweekly.com we are creating a model to predict if a given user will suscribe to their newsletter with only a few information on the user available. They would like to improve their newsletter's conversion rate.

## Main goals ðŸŽ¯
- Create an **EDA** with pre-processings and train a baseline model on the train set.
- Improve the model's **f1-score** on the test set with feature engineering, feature selection, regularization, gridsearch
- Make prediction and dump them into a csv file to be compared to other students.
- Analyze the best model parameters to see if there's any room for leverage on the newsletter's conversion rate

# Methods & Tools 
_Scikitlearn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Logistic regression, Random forest classifier, Extra trees classifier, GridSearchCV_
